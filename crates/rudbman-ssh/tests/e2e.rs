//! End-to-end tests for the tunnel.
//!
//! Unlike `tunnel.rs`, which only exercises paths that fail before a handshake
//! can happen, every test here stands up a real SSH server *inside the test
//! process* using russh's server side, plus a plain TCP echo server standing in
//! for the database, and drives the production [`SshTunnel`] between the two.
//! That makes the success path — authentication, `direct-tcpip`, the accept
//! loop, channel multiplexing and teardown — observable for the first time.
//!
//! Design notes:
//!
//! * Each test owns its own [`Bastion`]: a fresh ephemeral port for the SSH
//!   server, a fresh ephemeral port for the echo server, and a fresh Tokio
//!   runtime. Nothing is shared between tests, so the default parallel
//!   `cargo test` run is safe.
//! * The host key is a checked-in throwaway rather than a generated one, which
//!   keeps a random number generator out of the dependency tree. It is a test
//!   fixture and guards nothing.
//! * Nothing here sleeps to synchronise. Progress is observed by waiting for
//!   events, and every wait is bounded by [`EVENT_TIMEOUT`]; on expiry the panic
//!   message lists every event seen so far.
//! * The tunnel runs on its own thread with its own runtime (see
//!   [`SshTunnel::open`]), so the test thread only ever blocks on the *server's*
//!   runtime. The two never nest.
//!
//! # The test against a real server
//!
//! [`a_real_bastion_forwards_a_real_port`] is `#[ignore]`d because it needs an
//! sshd this repository cannot provide, and credentials it must not contain.
//! Point it at one and run it explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_HOST=bastion.example.com   # required
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_PORT=22                    # optional, defaults to 22
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_USER=ops                   # optional, defaults to $USER
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_PASSWORD=...               # one of these two; without
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_KEY=~/.ssh/id_ed25519      # either, the agent is used
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_REMOTE_HOST=db.internal    # optional, defaults to localhost
//! export RUDBMAN_SSH_TEST_REMOTE_PORT=22             # optional, defaults to 22
//!
//! cargo test -p rudbman-ssh --test e2e -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! The default target is the bastion's own SSH port, because that is the one
//! service a bastion is guaranteed to be running: the test asserts that the
//! forwarded port answers with an `SSH-2.0` banner. Set the remote host and port
//! to point it at a database instead.
