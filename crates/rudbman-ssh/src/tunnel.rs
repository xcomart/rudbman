//! The tunnel driver.
//!
//! [`SshTunnel::open`] moves every blocking or `async` operation onto a
//! dedicated OS thread that owns its own Tokio runtime, so a GUI thread can hold
//! an [`SshTunnel`] and never block on it. All communication happens through
//! channels: a single command flows in, [`TunnelEvent`]s flow out.
//!
//! The connect path here is deliberately *not* the one an interactive client
//! uses. No session channel is opened, no pty is requested and no shell is
//! started: forwarding needs none of them, and bastion accounts are routinely
//! configured with `/usr/sbin/nologin` and nothing but `direct-tcpip` allowed.
//! Asking for a shell on such an account fails a tunnel that would otherwise
//! have worked.
