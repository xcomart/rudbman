//! The vector icon set, embedded in the binary.
//!
//! gpui's [`svg`](gpui::svg) element resolves its `path` through the
//! [`AssetSource`] the application was built with — [`Icons`] here — and paints
//! the result as a *monochrome* sprite: resvg rasterises the file, only the
//! alpha channel survives, and the element's `text_color` supplies the colour.
//! Two things follow, and both are why these files look the way they do:
//!
//! * the colours written in an icon never reach the screen, only its coverage
//!   does, so a `fill-opacity` below `1` reads as a lighter shade of the tint;
//! * the tint is whatever the *element* asks for, and unlike text it is not
//!   inherited from a parent, so a hover that recolours a button has to reach
//!   the icon through [`group_hover`](gpui::InteractiveElement::group_hover).
//!
//! The bytes come from [`include_bytes!`], not from files read at run time: a
//! release then carries its icons wherever it is unpacked, and packaging has
//! nothing extra to ship. Cargo tracks the embedded files itself, so an edited
//! icon rebuilds the crate without help from `build.rs`.
//!
//! The set is deliberately the M0 shell's and nothing more: the window
//! controls, the two buttons of the tab strip and the application mark. The
//! database marks — driver badges, table and view and procedure glyphs — arrive
//! with the explorer tree in M1/M2, where there is something to put them on.

/// The four window-control glyphs are drawn edge to edge of the 24×24 box

/// out thinner and smaller than the caption buttons of the platform they stand
/// in for.
///
/// They carry a heavier stroke than the rest of the set for the same reason —
/// `2.2` against the usual `1.8`. The caption strip renders them at 12 px
/// (`GLYPH_SIZE` in [`rudbman_ui::window_controls`]), which is half the
/// viewBox, so the stroke that reaches the screen is half what the file asks
/// for: `1.8` arrived as 0.9 px, a hairline no row of pixels could hold at full
/// coverage once it had been antialiased, and `2.2` arrives as 1.1 px instead.
/// All four share the value, including both rectangles of [`WINDOW_RESTORE`],

/// which is what makes it stand out among the icons of a desktop and what made
/// it vanish here — over dark chrome the tile and the title bar were the same
/// colour, and only the mark's outline came through. This one is the tile's
/// contents alone, and being an SVG it is tinted from the theme like every
/// other icon in the row, so it holds its contrast in a light and a dark theme
/// both.
///
/// **Placeholder.** The mark it draws is logman's prompt chevron, on loan until
